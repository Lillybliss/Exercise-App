# Exercise-App

Exercise App is a React Native application that allows users to track their workouts. It includes features like tracking the duration and laps for exercises like running and bicycling, navigating to suggested exercises, and adding exercises to a favorites list for easy access.

Features:
Add exercise to favorites
Navigate to suggested exercises
Screens stacked by type of exercises
Record and reset rep/lap counts

As the main contributor to this project, I set up the structure of the application through multiple stack navigators/screens. I wrote the code that provides conditional rendering based on the selected exercise, as well as its navigation to the suggested exercise. For the Favorites Screen, I would use Redux for the next version of this project in order to store a state throughout the entire application for the array of favorite exercises. At the moment the favorite exercise is carried over through route parameters, with the ability to remove it from the favorites list, but it does not stay as a global state. Additionally, I helped with testing and debugging the app to ensure it was functioning correctly.
